    Note that we are experiencing some rate limits from Discord, but we are working on multiple solutions to overcome this challenge.

## Configuring webhooks
In order to use webhooks (we only support Discord webhooks at the moment), you need to configure them in the main settings page. You will find this page on 
the sidebar.

Click on the `Add new webhook` button to start. Here you will have the option to add a webhook url, log levels and log resources. You must fill all the fields
with a value. 

<div style={{ paddingTop: 10 }}>
<img style={{ borderRadius: 8 }} src="https://r2.fivemanage.com/docs_discord_webhooks.png" />
</div>

Once you have configured your webhook(s), save the settings. You may have to wait a couple minutes before our API server pick up the changes.
