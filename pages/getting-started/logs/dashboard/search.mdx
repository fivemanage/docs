## Searching and filtering logs

### Searching

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to search and filter logs.

You can search for logs by clicking on `+ Add filter` in the search bar. You can search by `message`, `resource` and any `metadata` property you want. These will show up in the dropdown when you click on the filter button.
Metadata properties are based on the properties you send in the logs.

* 1. Click on `+ Add filter`
* 2. Select the property you want to search by. It will show up as green once selected.
* 3. Enter the value you want to search for and click on `Enter` to apply the filter.

Once you have added the filter, you can see the filter in the search bar. You can remove the filter by clicking on the `x` icon.

### Filtering

You can filter logs by `level` and `Date Range`. The levels are based on the levels you send in the logs.

#### Level
