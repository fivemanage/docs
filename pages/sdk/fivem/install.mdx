## Installation & Setup

1. **Download the SDK:** Obtain the latest release of the Fivemanage SDK from the **[release page](https://github.com/fivemanage/sdk/releases/latest)**. Ensure you download the `fmsdk.zip` file. It's recommended to download this release instead of cloning the repository unless you intend to build the project yourself.

2. **Extract to Resources:** Unzip and place the `fmsdk` folder into your FiveM server's `resources` folder.

3. **Setup Dependencies:** If not already present, download and set up `screenshot-basic` by following its **[installation instructions](https://github.com/citizenfx/screenshot-basic?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)**. This resource is essential for capturing client screen images.

4. **Configure Server CFG:**

   - Make sure `screenshot-basic` is started before `fmsdk` in your `server.cfg`. Add the following lines:
     ```
     ensure screenshot-basic  # Only add this line if `screenshot-basic` is not already ensured in your configuration.
     ensure fmsdk    # The SDK must be started after the `screenshot-basic` resource.
     ```
   - Add the following ConVars to your `server.cfg` for API authentication:
     ```
     set FIVEMANAGE_MEDIA_API_KEY your_api_key
     set FIVEMANAGE_LOGS_API_KEY your_api_key
     ```
     Learn more about ConVars in the **[FiveM documentation](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-reference/convars/)**.

5. **Resource Config:** Review and adjust the settings in `config.json` to match your preferences and requirements. This file contains important configuration options that affect how the SDK operates on your server.
